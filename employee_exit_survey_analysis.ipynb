    "In this project exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia are used for an analysis.\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to find out:\n",
    "- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data from DETE is collected in `dete_survey.csv` and constructed as followed:\n",
    "- ID: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "- SeparationType: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "- Cease Date: The year or month the person's employment ended\n",
    "- DETE Start Date: The year the person began employment with the DETE\n",

    "The data from TAFE is collected in `tafe_survey.csv` and constructed as followed:\n",
